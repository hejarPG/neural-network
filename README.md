# Neural Networks: From-Scratch Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on building a neural network from scratch. It demonstrates how to implement the core components of a fully-connected neural network step by step, using basic Python and numerical operations.

## What This Is
This project is an educational exploration of how neural networks work under the hood. Instead of relying on pre-built libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, everything is implemented from scratch to give a clear understanding of the fundamentals.

The implementation is tested on two datasets:
- **MNIST Dataset**: A collection of handwritten digits used for image classification tasks.
- **California Housing Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting housing prices based on various features.
